# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects Repository

## 📚 Overview
This repository serves as a central hub for multiple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects across various domains. EDA is a crucial step in the **data science workflow** that helps understand data distributions, detect patterns, clean datasets, and derive valuable insights before applying machine learning models.

---

## 🔍 Purpose
- 🔢 **Data Exploration**: Uncover hidden trends and anomalies in datasets.
- 📝 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- 🌀 **Visualization**: Use charts, histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and other visual tools.
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering**: Create new meaningful features for modeling.
- 🔄 **Transformation**: Normalize and scale data to improve model performance.
